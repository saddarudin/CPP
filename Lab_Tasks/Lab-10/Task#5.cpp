Constructor:
It is used to initialize the state of an object. A constructor must not have a return type.
Private: 
Private is used to hide your personal information in coding so that no one can access your data
Public:
We use public access specifier to make something public that is any one can access your data
Set():
This is user defined method in which we usually set our data
Get():
It is also a user defined method in which we usually get data from user
Static Class members:
Static member is shared by by all objects of the class.
All static data is initialized to zero when the first object is created.*/
